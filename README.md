# Hey there! I'm Naytitorn Chaovirachot 👋
I like using software to work on real-world problems, especially ones that sit between different fields.

Most of my projects involve collecting data (signals, behavior, environments), processing it, and building tools so the results can be inspected and understood — not just produced.

Current

EEG analysis & visualization platform
Python · MNE · FastAPI · React
Interactive inspection of signal-processing pipelines instead of static outputs.

Background

Eye-tracking research on visual navigation (Kyoto Institute of Technology)

Automated regression testing infrastructure (SME Development Bank)

Behavioral data application combining sleep logs, environment data, and sentiment

I tend to work on

applied machine learning · experimental systems · interdisciplinary software · data understanding tools
